# Public Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In last year of METU we took design courses called EE493 and EE494. To make it more realistic, our professors call our project teams as `Companies`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make the development process more realistic, we decided to create this organization.
